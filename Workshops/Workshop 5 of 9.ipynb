    "## Strings\n",
    "Strings are a sequence of characters used to form a piece of text. You can create a string with single quotes 'example string' or double quotes \"another example string\". A multi-line quote is created by using three quotes.\n",
    "* Since they are a sequence type, you can apply sequence operations, index, slice, and iterate through each character with a for loop\n",
    "* String methods allow for text to be processed easily\n",
    "* Can use the input function to ask the user for an input\n",
    "* Can use a formatted string to clearly communicate messages to the user\n",

    "## Sets\n",
    "A set is an unordered collection of data where each value is unique. Sets are mutable, so you can change the values stored in a set. A set can be created with curly braces eg. {1, 2, 3} or with the set function.\n",
    "* Cannot index since a set is unordered\n",
    "* Can iterate through a set with a for loop\n",
    "* Offer a convenient way to remove duplicate entries from a list - just convert it to a set!\n",

    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "A dictionary is a set of key : value pairs. The key serves as some unique identifier, and the value provides some information associated with that key. You can create a dictionary with curly braces.\n",
    "* Dictionaries use a named index (the key name) rather than a positional index.\n",
    "* Ordered based on when entry was added to dictionary.\n",
    "* Can use the keys method to access dictionary keys, the values method to access dictionary values, and the items method to access both.\n",
    "* Can iterate through the keys or values (or both) with a for loop.\n",
    "* A good way to represent data or physical objects.\n",

    "An array is a data type that represents a collection of data in a structured format. They are similar to lists except:\n",
    "* All elements of an array must be of the same data type.\n",
    "* Arrays can be n-dimensional. For example, a 2-dimensional array would have rows and columns.\n",

    "* Access to element-wise operators\n",
    "* Boolean indexing for filtering\n",
    "* Access to functions and methods for statistics\n",
